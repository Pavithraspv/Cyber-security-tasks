# Cyber-security-task/Finance calculator
This is a Capstone project created using Python.
Here I created a program that allows the user to access two different finance calculators:

*Investment calculator:
 To calculate the amount of interest user will earn on thier investment
 
*Home Loan repayment calculator:
 Bond-to calculate the amount user will have to pay on a home loan
